Benchmarks:
File format: GDSII
The minimum spacing is 100nm, and it can be easily scaled to 10nm

Binary:
usage: ./stoma benckmark_file  TYPE  Colorable_DISTANCE   [Template_max(default=2)]  [DSA_DISTANCE(default=300)] [MIS_LIMIT(default=300)]

Colorable_DISTANCE : the minimum distance between two vias that can be colored the same
DSA_DISTANCE: the maximum distance between two vias that can be grouped
MIS_LIMIT: limit for # of maximal independent set in enumeration(DP+DSA), which is only useful for very dense layout.

TYPE=1: DP+DSA
TYPE=2: DP+DSA in DAC'15
TYPE=3: TP+DSA
TYPE=4: TP+DSA in DAC'15
TYPE=5: DP+DSA by ILP
TYPE=6: TP+DSA by ILP

example: ./stoma ./via_benchmarks/fft1.via1.txt 1 310

To generate gds output, add '-output' at the end of the command line.
example: ./stoma ./via_benchmarks/fft1.via2.txt 1 310 2 300 300 -output

layer 10,15,20: mask 1,2,3
layer 12: grouping
layer 13: conflict

Note:
Please make sure the input contains the layout of only one layer.
